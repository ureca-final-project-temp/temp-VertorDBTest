/**
 * Latency and recall for one slice of the query set. Filtered and unfiltered queries are
 * reported apart because they exercise different code paths in every product.
 *
 * <p>{@code recall} averages only the searches whose query has a non-empty exact top-K
 * ({@code scoredQueries}). Searches for a query whose filter matches no document are counted in
 * {@code emptyGroundTruthQueries} and scored by whether the store correctly returned nothing;
 * {@code emptyGroundTruthViolations} counts those that returned rows anyway. Folding them into the
 * average as a free 1.0 both inflates recall and hides the filter defect.
 *
 * <p>{@code recall} is null when the slice has no scored query.
